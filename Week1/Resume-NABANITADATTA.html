I want to have loving relationships but I don't want to depend on anyone for anything. I like taking part in extra-curricular activities. I am particularly fond of mathematics as the subject is quite interesting and love solving the maths problems whenever I get time.
              </br>I am a very ambitious person. I have always been a best student in my class and want to continue the trend even as I take on higher challenges in life. I wanted to take up the science stream as wished to study Software Engineering. The field of new Technologies has always fascinated me. 
            </br> I am also blessed to have a supportive family and a bunch of fun-loving friends in my life.
